### 2. Draw a Polygon:
- Add a polygon feature to the map.

### 3. Draw a Rectangle:
- Add a rectangle feature to the map.

### 4. Style the Rectangle:
- Set the fill color of the rectangle to `rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2)`.
- Set the boundary color to red.

### 5. Zoom to Maximum Extent:
- Write code to zoom the map to its maximum extent where both the polygon and rectangle are shown at their largest size.

### 6. Text at the Center of the Rectangle:
- Write the text "rectangle" at the center of the rectangle.
- Give the text a font size of 10px.

### 7. Dynamic Font Size:
- Currently, the font size is not affected when zooming in or out.
- Modify the code so that the font size decreases when zooming out of the map.
- Adjust the text size according to your preference.
